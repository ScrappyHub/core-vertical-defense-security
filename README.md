# CORE VERTICAL — Defense & Security

This repository defines the Defense & Security interpretation layer for CORE.

It translates physics-engine outputs into anomaly detection, threat assessment, and situational awareness workflows.

## Scope
- Anomaly detection pipelines
- Acoustic / EM / vibration threat interpretation
- Controlled-access dashboards
- Signal coherence and deviation analysis
- Sensor fusion review tooling

## Non-Scope
- No weapons systems
- No physics engines
- No autonomous decision authority
- No platform governance

## Architecture Position
Consumes truth data from CORE engines and RGSR.
Acts strictly as an interpretation and presentation layer.

## Governance
All features are subject to CORE platform governance.
This repo cannot override access, safety, or ethical constraints.
