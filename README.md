# CORE VERTICAL — Defense & Security Systems

This repository defines the Defense & Security vertical for CORE.

It is a **high-integrity, physics-based threat interpretation system**
used for detection, classification, and analysis of physical phenomena.

## Physics Stack (Authoritative)

- ARES — acoustic propagation & detection
- MAGNETAR — EM fields, radar, RF behavior
- HYDRA — underwater acoustics & flow
- ATMOS — air coupling, pressure waves
- KINETIC — structural vibration & impact
- SIGNAL — anomaly detection & coherence
- RGSR — cross-domain fusion

## Real-World Phenomena Modeled

- Submarines & underwater vehicles
- Missiles & rockets
- Aircraft & drones
- Explosions & shockwaves
- Underground tunnels & voids
- EM / RF interference & spoofing

## What This Vertical Is

- A **physics-first detection system**
- An **anomaly and pattern interpretation platform**
- A **non-speculative analysis environment**

## What This Vertical Is Not

- Not a weapons system
- Not command & control
- Not autonomous targeting

## Registries & Lenses

- Threat signature registry
- Sensor fusion profiles
- Environmental presets
- Risk classification schemas

## Governance & Restrictions

- High-risk vertical
- Access is tightly gated
- Outputs are interpretive, not directive
- All activity is auditable under CORE
